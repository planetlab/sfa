%description
This package provides the python libraries for the PlanetLab implementation of SFA

%description cm
This package implements the SFA interface which serves as a layer
between the existing PlanetLab NodeManager interfaces and the SFA API.
 
%description plc
This package implements the SFA interface which serves as a layer
between the existing PlanetLab interfaces and the SFA API.

%description client
This package provides the client side of the SFA API, in particular
sfi.py, together with other utilities.

%description sfatables
sfatables is a tool for defining access and admission control policies
in an SFA network, in much the same way as iptables is for ip
networks. This is the command line interface to manage sfatables

%description flashpolicy
This package provides support for adobe flash client applications.

* Mon Oct 04 2010 Thierry Parmentelat <thierry.parmentelat@sophia.inria.fr> - sfa-1.0-1
- various bugfixes and cleanup, improved/harmonized logging

* Tue Sep 07 2010 Tony Mack <tmack@cs.princeton.edu> - sfa-0.9-16
- truncate login base of external (ProtoGeni, etc) slices to 20 characters
  to avoid returning a PLCAPI exception that might confuse users.
- Enhance PLC aggregate performace by using a better filter when querying SliceTags.      
- fix build errors.  

* Tue Aug 24 2010 Tony Mack <tmack@cs.princeton.edu> - sfa-0.9-15
- (Architecture) Credential format changed to match ProtoGENI xml format
- (Architecture) All interfaces export a new set of methods that are compatible
   with the ProtoGeni Aggregate spec. These new methods are considered a 
   replacement  for the pervious methods exported by the interfaces. All 
   previous methods are still exported and work as normal, but they are 
   considered deprecated and will not be supported in future releases.  
- (Architecture) SFI has been updated to use the new interface methods.
- (Architecture) Changed keyconvet implementation from c to python.
- (Architecture) Slice Manager now attempts looks for a delegated credential
  provided by the client before using its own server credential.
- (Archiceture) Slice Interface no longers stores cache of resources on disk. 
  This cache now exists only in memory and is cleared when service is restarted
  or cache lifetime is exceeded.  
- (Performance) SliceManager sends request to Aggregates in parallel instead 
  of sequentially.
- (Bug fix) SFA tickets now support the new rspec format.
- (Bug fix) SFI only uses cahced credential if they aren't expired.
- (Bug fix) Cerdential delegation modified to work with new credential format.
- (Enhancement) SFI -a --aggregatge option now sends requests directly to the
  Aggregate instead of relaying through the Slice Manager.
- (Enhancement) Simplified caching. Accociated a global cache instance with
  the api handler on every new server request, making it easier to access the 
  cache and use in more general ways.     

* Thu May 11 2010 Tony Mack <tmack@cs.princeton.edu> - sfa-0.9-11
- SfaServer now uses a pool of threads to handle requests concurrently
- sfa.util.rspec no longer used to process/manage rspecs (deprecated). This is now handled by sfa.plc.network and is not backwards compatible
- PIs can now get a slice credential for any slice at their site without having to be a member of the slice
- Registry records for federated peers (defined in registries.xml, aggregates.xml) updated when sfa service is started
- Interfaces will try to fetch and install gids from peers listed in registries.xml/aggregates.xml if gid is not found in /etc/sfa/trusted_roots dir   
- Component manager does not install gid files if slice already has them  
- Server automatically fetches and installs peer certificats (defined in registries/aggregates.xml) when service is restarted.
- fix credential verification exploit (verify that the trusted signer is a parent of the object it it signed)
- made it easier for root authorities to sign their sub's certifiacate using the sfa-ca.py (sfa/server/sfa-ca.py) tool
